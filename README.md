# imogenviz

Inspired by Imogen Heaps powerglove looper thing I saw on youtube and 
@neles0n on Instagram.


Mostly hobby project for myself to create a mixing studio / thereminesque instrument
I can have as a cool toy :)

Currently supports a pad and some basic drum samples.

Written in python because that is what I feel is best for prototyping and because I am
used to it.
First candidate that comes to mind is C++ which would have the perfomance gains
and enough support/libraries needed.

## Future features

 - A way to switch instruments, rotation of hand
 - Distance between hands denote reverb in mix / instrument
 - Ability to loop
 - Some assisted quantization to help mitigate FPS / runtime
 - General speed improvements
    - threading
    - mediapipe implementation (currently copied from some medium article)
 - Microphone support to add vocals
 - More instruments other than pad
